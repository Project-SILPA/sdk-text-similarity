Text Similarity

SILPA - Text Similarity
This module will compare two texts for their similarity. Based on the similarity it will give a number between 0 and 1. 
1 means both text are similary. 0 means texts are completely different. 
A value in between 0 and 1 indicates how much they are similar.

The algorithm uses an n-grams model and cosine similarity.

This module is a Java implementation of Text Similarity module - [SILPA](http://silpa.org.in/) and is a part of SILPA Android SDK.
